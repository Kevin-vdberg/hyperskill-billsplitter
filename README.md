## Hyperskill project: Bill splitter

**Project assignment**: 
Everyone likes eating out with friends. The more friends, the better, but the bill time is always a bummer, to say the least. Why not develop a tool to keep the fun alive and make sure that everyone pays an equal amount.

- Add your friends to the party!
- Split your bill into equal shares.
- Pick one name from the dictionary and make them lucky!
- Update the split values and print the final dictionary to settle the bill.
